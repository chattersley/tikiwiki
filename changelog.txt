TikiWiki Changelog
------------------

All developers are invited to add relevant changes in that file as they
apply them to the CVS source. You can optionally include an identifer
for the origin of the change (author, submitter, anyone involved) but
that's not so useful as the cvs log knows who adds what when.

Use the following tags to distinguish changes :
* [NEW] apply if something new was added in tikiwiki
* [MOD] is an enhancement; not really new but makes things work better
* [FIX] can be used for bug fixes of any sort
* [SEC] (new since 1.9.4) for security fix operations
* -[DB] (new since 1.9.4) for changes in the database

Please wrap your lines at 80 characters and indent them with spaces only.

   PHP, we copied those features and integrated the forums with the Tiki
   permission system, rankings, modules and search engine. There's a lot about
   forums so I guess it's best to stop the description here, the documentation
   will introduce all the features in forums.

   this will prevent automatic thumbnail generation. Some users wanted this
   feature because thumbnail generation didn't work or they wanted to upload

   as the full image so you can use this feature. Thumbnails will be displayed
   using the size assignated for thumbnails to the image gallery.
